# Haarcascade feature detector & Background remover
##### This is a ComputerVision project from lecture [COMP508](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~yyemez/comp508/index.htm) by ‪Yucel Yemez‬ 
#
Main goals of the project are:
- Implement a background remover similiar to the one found on video-chatting applications
- Implement a Haarcascade feature detector to detect eye, nose, or similiar face features
- Add other images (ie, sunglasses) to found coordinates of face features
